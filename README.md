# Citadel Women’s Datathon 2025 – Gasoline Price Analysis
This project was developed during the Citadel Women’s Datathon 2025 (Europe), a 4-day event focused on real-world financial challenges. Our team investigated the volatility of gasoline prices in the U.S., exploring their relationship with consumer prices and the stock market.

## Project Overview
**Objective:** Analyse lag-lead relationships between gasoline prices, consumer behavior, and stock market indicators.

**Dataset:** Provided by Correlation One, containing historical gasoline prices, transport data, and stock indices.

**Outcome:** Generated insights into the temporal dynamics of price changes and proposed data-driven recommendations for policymakers.
